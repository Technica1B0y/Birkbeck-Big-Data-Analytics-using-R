This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


• Create a vector x
– starting from 5.3
– ending at 8.00
– length is 10 

```{r}
x<- seq(5.3,8, length = 10)
```

Create another vector y
– starting from 3.5
– ending at or less than 7.9
– each term is 0.4 more than the previous one
y= 3.5, 3.9, 4.3, …

```{r}
y<-seq(3.5, 7.9, by= 0.4)
```


Slide 16: Creating matrix B
```{r}
data<-matrix(1:40,4,10,byrow=TRUE)
data[,-c(2,4,6,8,10)]
data[c(2,4),c(3,5)]
```
Slide 16: Creating matrix C

```{r}
a<-matrix(c(1),1,1)
a<-matrix(c(1,1),1,2,byrow=TRUE)
```
